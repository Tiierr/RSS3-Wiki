# Week 9 - Apr 15, 2022

Welcome to the shiny RSS3 Tech Weekly.

## What has happened

Development:

1. We have been working on the integration of different components.
2. We have fixed numerous bugs along the way, all our work is [open and transparent on GitHub](https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/RSS3-PreGod/commits/develop?after=c5096da34a788c279795c5f7c4e9c5ba19e14e3a+104&branch=develop).

Since the upgrade from PreNode to PreGod is breaking, we have been working closely with community developers to help with their migration processes.

## What is going to happen

1. We will be continuing to work on the beta instance of PreGod, focusing on the optimization side.
2. Some of the dev members will be working on implementing more features from the Protocol v0.4.0.

Thatâ€™s it for the week, see you all next week!
