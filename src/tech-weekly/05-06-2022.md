# Week 12 - May 6, 2022

Welcome to the shiny RSS3 Tech Weekly. This week we have been busing working on the next version of PreGod (v0.5.0). In this version, we plan to simplify APIs as a response to our developer community.

## What has happened

Weâ€™ve made the following decisions according to the strategic adjustment:

1. The APIs will be reduced to 2:
    1. Returning a list of feeds for a specific user
    2. Returning a list of feeds for a list of users
2. The scope of feed is redefined to include asset (NFTs and tokens) transfers for this version.
3. Existing APIs in v0.4.0 will be de-coupled and handled by other RSS3 projects.

## What is going to happen

We have concluded the relevant research, and the development of v0.5.0 will kickstart on Monday, and we estimate that it will take less than 2 weeks.

Thatâ€™s it for the week, see you all next week!
