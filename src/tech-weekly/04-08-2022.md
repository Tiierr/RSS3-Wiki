# Week 8 - April 8, 2022

Welcome to the shiny RSS3 Tech Weekly.

## What has happened

Development:

1. We have finished integrating Hub and Indexer.
2. We have set up the relevant monitoring services to collect metrics from our test instance.
3. We have performed various tests on PreGod and improved the performance along the way.

## What is going to happen

1. A PreGod beta instance is now up and running (add a link here), if you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please come to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rss3) and talk to the dev team directly. Alternatively, you can open an issue on our [GitHub](https://github.com/NaturalSelectionLabs/RSS3-PreGod).
2. Adjusted some queries of the protocol.

We hope you enjoy the performance improvement offered by PreGod.

Thatâ€™s it for the week, see you all next week!
